# Linear-Regression

**Advertising Dataset(Linear Regression)**
1. Did EDA to understand the relationships between marketing spend on each channel type(TV, RADIO and newspapers) and total sales of the product. 
2. Observed using pairplot and scatterplots that TV and radio showed could correlation with sales but newspaper did not.
3. Traned a linear regression model to obtain an r2 score of 91.8%
4. Plotted residuals to check whether the Linear Regression is suited to the problem. Also checked that the residuals are normally distributed or not.
5. Used Polynomial Features of degreee 2,3 and 4 to improve model.Acheived an r2 score of 98.4%.
6. Plotted train and test error against Polynomial degree to choose degree so model is not overfitting.
7. Used Standardization, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net to further improve the model.
